The goal of gglinedensity is to bring the DenseLines algorithm to R via ggplot2,
providing a "derived density visualisation (that) allows users both to see the aggregate
trends of multiple (time) series and to identify anomalous extrema" ([Moritz and Fisher, 2018](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1808.06019)).

## Installation

You can install the development version of gglinedensity like so:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("hrryt/gglinedensity")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ggplot2)
library(gglinedensity)
ggplot(txhousing, aes(date, median, group = city)) +
  stat_line_density(bins = 50, drop = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +
  xlim(2000, 2015)
```
